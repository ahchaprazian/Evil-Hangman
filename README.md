# Evil-Hangman
The Hangman Lab was a semester-long project where the language used C to write multiple  complex data structures to create a game of hangman. With the use of a vector to store the  words and an AVL tree to sort them an impossible to beat game of hangman was created.  The computer as your opponent there is no chance that you can win this game of Hangman.
